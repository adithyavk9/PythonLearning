Class has properties + behaviour.\n","Properties-----> variables or attributes.\n","Behaviour ------> Methods/functions.\n","\n","What is a class?\n","A class can be considered as a template definition of the methods and variables in a particular kind of object.\n","It is a blueprint for an object.\n","\n","A class is a prototype of an object that defines a set of attributes that\n","characterize any object of such a class. The attributes are data members\n","(class variables and instance variables, see below) and methods (i.e. functions).\n","\n","Instance:\n","An instance is an individual object of a certain class.\n","For example, an object my_position that belongs to a class Position\n","is an instance of the class Position.\n","\n","What is object?\n","Objects are the instances of a particular class.\n","\n","Class attribute: A class attribute is a variable that is shared by all instances\n"," of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the\n","  class' methods.\n","\n","Instance attribute: An instance attribute is a variable that is defined inside a\n"," method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.\n","\n","######\n","Principles of Object Oriented Programming\n","a) Abstraction\n","Data abstraction is one of the most essential concepts of Python OOPs\n"," which is used to hide irrelevant details from the user and show the details\n","  that are relevant to the users.\n","\n","Data abstraction in Python is a programming concept that hides complex\n"," implementation details while exposing only essential information and\n","  functionalities to users. In Python, we can achieve data abstraction by using abstract classes.\n","\n","b) Encapsulation\n","Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming\n"," (OOP). It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data\n","  within one unit.\n","\n","This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and\n"," can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change,\n","  an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method.\n","  Those types of variables are known as private variables.\n","\n","c) Inheritance\n","One of the core concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) languages is\n"," inheritance. It is a mechanism that allows you to create a hierarchy of classes\n","  that share a set of properties and methods by deriving a class from another class.\n","  Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.\n","\n","Benefits of inheritance are:\n","    i) Inheritance allows you to inherit the properties of a class,\n","    i.e., base class to another, i.e., derived class. The benefits of\n","    Inheritance in Python are as follows:\n","    ii) It represents real-world relationships well.\n","    iii) It provides the reusability of a code. We don’t have to write the same code\n","    again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without\n","      modifying it.\n","    iv) It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another\n","    class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.\n","    v) Inheritance offers a simple, understandable model structure.\n","    vi) Less development and maintenance expenses result from an inheritance.\n","\n","d) Polymorphism\n","polymorphism means the same function name (but different signatures) being used for different types.\n","The key difference is the data types and number of arguments used in function.\n","e.g. built-in len() function for list, tuple, strings\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","# General Structure\n","\n","# class className:\n","#     def function1():\n","#         statement(s)\n","#     def function2():\n","#         statement(s)\n","#     def functionN():\n","#         statement(s)\n","\n","# className objectName\n","# objectName.function1()"],"metadata":{"id":"PHZLz7WpLe9i"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\"\"\"\n","The roles of a costructor (it is a special function) is\n","    1. creating a object.\n","    2. intializing the attributes.\n","Constructors are called by the class name.\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","# Constructor:\n","# def __init__():\n","#     statements(s)"],"metadata":{"id":"XI-apk-PAVjf"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class computer:\n","    def config(self):\n","        print(\"i5 16GB 1 TB\");\n","\n","c1 = computer()\n","# config() # you can not directly call this.
